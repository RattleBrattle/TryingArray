# TryingArray
Trying out arrays in C by coding different types of simple programs and ideas.

This is a simple C source file that uses a 2D array with initialized numbers and by using nested loops, prints out the Year and it's total rainfall per month.

This is a simple program in my journey to become better and better at the C programming language.
